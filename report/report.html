        <h1>TUI for 3D Rotation</h1>
        <p>By: Alessio Masi & Jonathan Breitenthaler</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In environments such as CAD, the object to be designed has to be rotated extensively during the creative process, which can be tedious with a standard input device such as a computer mouse. To address this problem, various approaches have been taken such as computer mouses specifically designed for CAD projects or touch displays. A solution we were especially interested in was a separate tangible user interface to be used to rotate the object in design. Technology for this kind of interface already exists and studies have proven it to be eligible (see section <a href="#rel_work">Related Work</a>), however we noticed that the shape of the TUI was never questioned. In the papers described in the Related Work section we saw different shapes used for this purpose, which led us to our goal to find the most suiting shape for a tangible user interface used to rotate 3D objects. 
            This optimal shape should be operable one-handed as to limit fatigue and increase efficiency while using the interface alongside a keyboard and mouse. The constraints for this shape therefore are:
             <ul>
                <li>Comfortable fit for one hand</li>
                <li>Easy to rotate</li>
                <li>Placeable on table</li>
             </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 id="rel_work">Related Work</h2>
        <p>
            There is some related work concerning the topic of TUIs for 3D rotation, however no papers were found on the topic of the shape of such objects specifically.
        
            Especially pioneering for us was a paper by Besancon et al. [1] which conducted a study comparing three different input methods for a 3D virtual environment. They evaluated the performance of touch-based, mouse-based and tangible interaction. Their results aligned with their hypothesis of the tangible interaction being faster than the touch-based, which in turn was faster than the mouse-based interaction. The three different interactions only differed in terms of time, in terms of precision however they were very similar. Inspiring for us was the experimental setup, using a docking task to evaluate performance and precision as well as the shape they used for the tangible interaction. They did not clarify why they used the shape of a cuboctahedron, but as it suited our criteria we took it as an inspiration for one of our shapes. 
            Sheridan and Kortuem [2] base their design of different cubes on the Gibson concept of affordance. They study cubes in different sizes and materials 
            to be used as a physical interface for ubiquitous environments and test them for different types of movements, among them a couple movements of interest to us: rotation and translation.     
            The cube as a shape for similiar kinds of interaction is also used in other papers e.g. by Abdelmohsen and Do [3] or Ferscha and Vogl [4].
