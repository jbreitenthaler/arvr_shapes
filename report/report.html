        <h1>TUI for 3D Rotation</h1>
        <p>By: Alessio Masi & Jonathan Breitenthaler</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In environments such as CAD, the object to be designed has to be rotated extensively during the creative process, which can be tedious with a standard input device such as a computer mouse. To address this problem, various approaches have been taken such as computer mouses specifically designed for CAD projects or touch displays. A solution we were especially interested in was a separate tangible user interface to be used to rotate the object in design. Technology for this kind of interface already exists and studies have proven it to be eligible (see section <a href="#rel_work">Related Work</a>), however we noticed that the shape of the TUI was never questioned. In the papers described in the Related Work section we saw different shapes used for this purpose, which led us to our goal to find the most suiting shape for a tangible user interface used to rotate 3D objects. 
            This optimal shape should be operable one-handed as to limit fatigue and increase efficiency while using the interface alongside a keyboard and mouse. The constraints for this shape therefore are:
             <ul>
                <li>Comfortable fit for one hand</li>
                <li>Easy to rotate</li>
                <li>Placeable on table</li>
             </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 id="rel_work">Related Work</h2>
        <p>
            There is some related work concerning the topic of TUIs for 3D rotation, however no papers were found on the topic of the shape of such objects specifically.
        
            Especially pioneering for us was a paper by Besancon et al. [1] which conducted a study comparing three different input methods for a 3D virtual environment. They evaluated the performance of touch-based, mouse-based and tangible interaction. Their results aligned with their hypothesis of the tangible interaction being faster than the touch-based, which in turn was faster than the mouse-based interaction. The three different interactions only differed in terms of time, in terms of precision however they were very similar. Inspiring for us was the experimental setup, using a docking task to evaluate performance and precision as well as the shape they used for the tangible interaction. They did not clarify why they used the shape of a cuboctahedron, but as it suited our criteria we took it as an inspiration for one of our shapes. 
            Sheridan and Kortuem [2] base their design of different cubes on the Gibson concept of affordance. They study cubes in different sizes and materials 
            to be used as a physical interface for ubiquitous environments and test them for different types of movements, among them a couple movements of interest to us: rotation and translation.     
            The cube as a shape for similiar kinds of interaction is also used in other papers e.g. by Abdelmohsen and Do [3] or Ferscha and Vogl [4]. 
        </p>
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>Our hypothesis shifted over the course of this project, starting from the idea of the cube being the best shape, as it is the most widely used and provides the best ability to orient the shape itself to specific angles. However when starting to implement the prototype we noticed that being able to rotate the shape to specific angles is not relevant. Due to this finding we shifted to the sphere being the most optimal shape for this purpose as it is the easiest to rotate with one hand.</p>
        <h2 id="appr">Approach</h2>

        <h3>Experimental Protocol</h3>
        <p> In the following section we will discuss our approach to find this optimal shape, providing also insights on the <a href="#impl">implementation</a> we designed.<br>
            In order to start our experiment the first step was to define three shapes we wanted to test. We decided to use the shape of a cube, a cuboctahedron and a sphere. The cube and the cuboctahedron were chosen because of their use in the papers described in the <a href="#rel_work">Related Work</a> section. In addition to that we chose a sphere due to its characteristic of a consistent surface, independent of its orientation making it very simple to rotate. <br>

            Image 1: The three chosen shapes in order of appearance: Cube, Sphere, Cuboctahedron 
            <br/><br/>
            Before diving into the user study, we decided to do a preliminary study in order to eliminate one of the three shapes beforehand. The preliminary study was done on 4 participants and the task was to try to mimic the rotation of an object displayed on the screen by a video of approximately 30 seconds,
            without having any visual feedback. To evaluate the three shapes at this stage we based our decision solely on the feedback provided by the participants. After performing the same task with all 
            three shapes we asked them to give a personal classification of the three shapes from best to worst.  <br>
            After completing this part we designed the final experiment. Firstly we ask the participant to perform a mental rotation test, in order to understand if the results we get from the docking task show a correlation with the ability of a person to identify the same object in different orientations. It has to be noted that this test was performed without time constraints. After performing this test the participants were faced with a challenge in which they had to perform a docking task with both of the two shapes left. This task consists in moving an object from a starting position to a target position, where the starting and target position only differ in their respective rotation. In our case the rotating and target object are the same: a block that we designed to be distinguishable in all rotations. The participants have to move the object from the starting position to the target position by rotating the TUI in their hand. They are required to perform the task with both of the shapes while the order in which the two shapes are given to the participants is alternated (to address possible learning transferred between the two shapes). 
            In order to help us understand which one is the best shape according to the hypothesis we made, we measured the time needed to complete the task, the number of errors and the distance between the position reached
            and the correct one, concerning the quantitative data. To calculate the rotational distance between two quaternions the following formula was used:
            <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                <mn>&#952;</mn>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <mo>arccos(</mo>
                <mo>&lt;</mo>
                <mn>q1</mn>
                <mo>,</mo>
                <mn>q2</mn>
                <mo>&gt;</mo>
                <mo>)</mo>
            </math><br/> 
             For the qualitative data we asked the participants to fill two questionnaires, the Nasa-TLX [5] and the SUS [6].
            The experiment was divided in two phases, a training phase and a test phase. The participants always started with a training where they had to perform 10 tasks. During this phase they recieved help by 
            visual cues to understand what the degree of precision required to complete the task is. To validate a task the user had to press the spacebar when they were close enough to the target rotation, with a maximum
            distance from 5 degrees which was imposed by the system. In particular, the object they were rotating was coloured green when they were in the accepted range of precision.
            After the training phase they started the test phase, where they had to perform 12 tasks as in the training but without the visual cues. If they tried to validate when they were not in the acceptance range, that action was marked as an error and they had to continue until they managed to achieve the needed precision. After completing the taskset with one shape, they were asked to fill the 
            two questionnaires and then they could start the taskset with the other shape. In total we had 12 participants
            split in two groups of 6 people, one group performed the taskset with the sphere first (Group 2) and the other group with the cuboctahedron first (Group 1). 
        </p>
        <h3 id="impl">Implementation</h3>
        <p>In this section we are going to briefly present the implementation of what we have done to perform the experiment. <br>
            The first thing we did was to build the models to be used in the preliminary study. We had to build the three shapes and we decided to laser cut both the cuboctahedron and the cube while for the sphere
            we used a tennis ball. Regarding the dimension we chose to take the volume of the tennisball at 149 cm<sup>3</sup> as a reference. We then designed the other two shapes to have apprroximately the same volume accordingly.
            At this stage we did not have the need to equip the objects with sensors considering the preliminary study was based only on a replication of movements.<br>
            After completing the preliminary study we needed to integrate sensors to detect the rotation in the two winner shapes. We used an IMU, the Grove - 6-Axis Accelerometer&Gyroscope(BMI088), which is a 6 DOF
            sensor combining both the measurements of the accelerometer and the gyroscope to detect the rotation of the object with higher precision. The sensor was then connected to an Arduino XIAO ESP32C3, which was powered by a 
            battery. Thanks to the WiFi capabilities of the Arduino we were able to put the package of the sensor, Arduino and battery inside the object, while eliminating the need for cables. The sensor was placed on one side of the
            object and firmly attached to it. Each prototype had his own sensor and Arduino. <br>
            To get the data from the sensor we used an arduino script to create a WiFi server to which we could connect to get the data. The most important implementation detail is that even if the sensor was calibrated,
            we still had a problem of drift, which is common for this kind of sensors, so in order to solve the problem we used the C library Fusion which implements the Madgwick AHRS algorithm giving us a filter to almost eliminate 
            the sensor drift. A small drift was still left after the filter application, worsening over time, so we decided to have the participants to do a recalibration of the sensor after every task. The filter output was sent to the WiFi client as quaternions. <br>
            To visually display and rotate the object we implemented a Processing sketch connecting to the WiFi server and reading data from the sensor in real time. All of the test logic was also implemented in this sketch as well as the computation of all needed metrics to evaluate the performance of the participants.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>In this section we are going to discuss the results obtained from the experiments, analyzing firstly the objective measures we collected and concluding with a brief overview over the subjective questionnaires.<br/><br/>
            The preliminary study gave us the following ranking and therefore eliminated the cube: 
<ol>
    <li>Sphere</li>
    <li>Cuboctahedron</li>
    <li>Cube</li>
</ol>
            As discussed in section <a href="#appr">Approach</a>, the first test proposed to the participants was a mental rotaion test, so we will start analyzing the results we got from this test. The test consists
            in recognizing objects in different rotations. For each task in the test, the participant is presented with one reference shape and four alternatives among which they have to find one or more instances of the reference object. From the results we got in this task we tried to find a correlation with the metrics we were measuring such as the completion time for both the two shapes. We compute a measure of correlation
            between these two variables which is reported in <a href="#corr_rot">Table 1</a>. <br/><br/>

Table 3: Correlation table between the mental rotation test and the average completion time for one task for both of the two shapes, Group 2. 

<br/> A value higher than 0.7(-0.7) indicates a strong correlation, while a value lower then 0.3(-0.3) indicates a
            mild correlation between the variables.
            <br/>
            <p>The first thing to do when performing a correlation score is to be sure that it makes sense to compute such a value in the specific use case. We think it was sensful because we wanted to see if there was a relation between the performance in the mental rotation test the task. What we can derive from these correlations is that a bad score on the mental rotation test is very likely to lead to a high completion time for the rotation tasks with the TUI. Looking at Table 2 we see that for
                Group 1 there is a very high correlation between the two variables. This group had bad scores on the mental rotation test throughout. However the other group with mixed scores on the mental rotation test, does not show this high correlation.This might be due the fact that the shape is uncommon and is not easy for the participants to easily understand the rotation they are performing with this shape, even if they show good capabilities in understanding rotations.             </p>
            <br>
            After analyzing the this correlation we will now focus on understanding if there is any form of learning during the training phase. To understand this we will focus on <a href="#fig-training-cubo">Picture 1</a>, which represents the two curves for the two shapes divided per group.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Figure 1: Images showing the learning curves for the training phase of the two shapes. Group 1 refers to the particpants that started with the cuboctahedron, while Group 2 refers to those who started with the sphere.
            <p> Observing the graphs we can see that the performance of the two shapes after 2/3 tasks is equivalent, meaning that the training necessary to obtain a good level of performance is reached very soon, and after that point
                we observe that the results are task-related and no more dependent on the amount of training that one got on a specific shape.
            </p>
            After evaluating the data we collected during the training phase, we can finally move on to the test phase. We will firstly put our attention on understanding the distribution of the data in general and the general results we got, concluding the considerations on the test phase with an analysis taskwise rather than participant-wise. 
            In <a href="#fig-box-plot">Figure 2</a>, we can see the box plot of the overall data, both for the completion time and the accuracy.<br><br/>

            Figure 2: Images reporting the box plots for the two shapes for the two metrics we measured, completion time and precision.
            <p>If we look at the box plot for the precision data, what we can derive is that the two shapes are almost equivalent. If we look not only at the lower value reached but also at the distribution of the values (more details on the 
                variance in the <a href="#fig-std">Fig 3</a>), they fall into each other meaning we cannot derive any conclusion from this graph apart from the fact that they can be considered comparable.<br>
                If we now look at the graph depicting the completion time on the left, we can see almost the same result as discussed before with the exception that here the difference is even more reduced with respect to the previous case.
            </p>
            After plotting these graphs we wanted to investigate the results even further and so we decided to plot the graph below which represents the mean over the standard deviation to gather more insight on the spread of the data.
            <br/>

            Figure 3: Graphs reporting the average and the standard deviation for the two shapes in the three cases, Group 1, Group 2 and overall data for each shape.
            <p>What we see in this graph confirms what we have seen in <a href="#fig-box-plot">Figure 2</a>, and we can see that the performances over these two shapes are again comparable, and the variance is so high that
                we cannot conclude anything because we cannot find any consistency in any of the metrics we considered.
            </p> 
            After plotting the graphs divided per participant and not being able to find anything that could help on solve the research question that started this experiment, we decided to expand on insights 
            considering an taskwise analysis.
            Doing an taskwise analysis we wanted to understand whether there are tasks in the taskset that are distinguishable in terms of completion time and precision with respect to the two shapes.
            <br/>

            Figure 4: Bar chart representing the completion time of each task averaged on all the participants for the two shapes.
            <p>What we see from <a href="#fig-time-task">Figure 4</a> is that on average the two shapes are equivalent for most of the tasks, but there are some tasks where one of the two looks better than the other,
                so we decided to investigate this finding by analyzing the task in terms of their difference in rotational distance, meaning the distance between the starting position and the target position. Performing this analysis we could
                understand if the difference in completion time has a correlation to the difference in rotational distance. Furthermore, it could also tell us if there is a relation between the distance travelled and the performance of 
                one shape with respect to the other. The results of this analysis are reported in <a href="#tab-corr-2">Table 4</a>.

            Table 4: Correlation table between the distance travelled and the completion time and precision for the two shapes. A value higher than 0.7(-0.7) indicates a strong correlation, while a value lower then 0.3(-0.3) indicates a mild correlation between the variables. The table
            on top is related to the results of the cuboctahedron, while the table below is related to the sphere.
            <p>Analyzing the table, we notice that there is no strong correlation between any of the variables. Focusing on the one of our interest, we derive that there is a mild connection between the distance to be
                travelled and the completion time. In particular, when the distance is higher, the completion time tends to decrease and this is true for both of the shapes, as we can notice from the negative correlation in the second row of the time  column.
                This link is a bit stronger in the case of the sphere but it's still not strong enough to derive any real conclusion from it, however it seems interesting.

            After analyzing the objective data we collected, we will now focus on the subjective ones. We asked the participants to fill two questionnaires, the SUS and the Nasa-TLX. The Nasa-TLX is a questionnaire, used to assess the overall workload of a task, which is composed 
            by 6 different dimensions, mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort and frustration. The participant is required to select a value for each one of these factors and is then presented with all the possible combinations of the factors where he/she is required to select 
            the one that was more relevant in the task performed for each pair. These values are going to be used later as weights to compute a weighted average of the raw scores.

            <p><a href="#fig-nasa">Figure 5</a> shows a box plot representing the results of the questionnaire, reporting all the 6 factors and the overall workload for both of the shapes. What we can see is that even in this case
                the two shapes are comparable and there is none which felt heavier in terms of workload, and the fact that the variance is so high cannot give us any more details even looking at the factors independently.
            </p>
            The last questionnaire we did was the SUS. It is used to assess the usability of a system and is composed by 10 different sentences, where the users have to select how much they agree/disagree with the sentence 
            proposed using a rating from disagreement to agreement in 5 stages.

            In this type of questionnaire we decided to use keywords asssociated with the score to evaluate the results instead of only numerical values. The system has an acceptable score if it is above 68 points and our results are expressed in <a href="#fig-sus">Figure 6</a>. We can see both of the shapes are well above this threshold. For the first time, we can also see a gap between the two with the Sphere that had an average score of 80 and the 
            cuboctahedron of 73. Despite the difference not being that large, the general usabilty of the sphere was more appreciated by the participants.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In this project we tried to find the optimal shape for a TUI used to rotate an object in a 3D virtual environment. For this purpose three different shapes were chosen: A sphere, a cuboctahedron and a cube. We conducted two studies, a small preliminary study to eliminate one of the
            initial shapes and a bigger final study with the goal to come a decision on the shape to use in such a context. This should be achieved by collecting quantitative as well as qualitative data, for more details see sections <a href="#appr">Approach</a> and <a href="#results">Results</a>. 
            In the preliminary study it became clear that the cube was not going to be the best shape for our purpose, so the cuboctahedron and the sphere were implemented for the final study.
            Looking at the data from the final study we could not conclude a winner in this scenario. The quantitative data did show great similarity between the two shapes as well as a high variation
            in the collected data, rendering a decision impossible. Workload analysis from the Nasa-TLX did not yield a decisive result and user acceptance from the SUS was also similar for both shapes however with average scores of 74 for the Cuboctahedron and 81 for the Sphere,
             both in an accepable range. Overall the sphere has a slight advantage, however too small to be considered decisive for an experiment with a small number of participants. In the end the cuboctahedron and the sphere both
             show good capabilities to be used as a TUI for 3D rotation, to decide on one shape however more research needs to be done. For future research it should be considered to choose an implementation with a better appproach to deal with drift,
              as the recalibration interferes with the experiment in a way that increases frustration of the participants.
